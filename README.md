### A lightweight and powerful data grid for Knockout

[![SauceLabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/frypan-knockout-grid.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/frypan-knockout-grid)

### Features

- Column sorting
- Column filtering
- Searching
- Automatic Virtualization if needed, with automatic resizing
- Infinite Scrolling
- Custom column templates, with built-in one for link rendering
- Column resizing
- Column drag and drop reordering
- Asyncrounous (Remote) data sources
- Persists and load settings to local storage or anywhere else
- Dynamic column discovery - an array of objects (or async data function) is all you need to get started
